# Structured File Processing Specification: CSV and JSON

## Purpose

Define a simple, traceable process for reading CSV files and JSON objects, validating their input fields and values, mapping accepted values to an internal model, and retaining source evidence.

## Principles

- Preserve the original uploaded CSV or JSON file unchanged.
- Treat every CSV cell as a string when it is first read; parse JSON primitives according to JSON's native types.
- Keep the raw string even after a value is parsed or normalized.
- Keep the canonical representation independent of supplier-specific headers and internal application field names.
- Map only validated source values to the internal model.
- Do not silently discard or replace invalid values; quarantine them with errors.

## Deployment network constraint

Superseded by the LLD (sections 1 and 23). The processing service runs in a shared VPC owned by a separate shared-network Terraform state, with no NAT gateway; the data-fetch service runs outside any VPC. Processing submission and the read routes are served by an API Gateway HTTP API that requires AWS IAM authorization (SigV4); there is no internal load balancer.

## CSV example input

```csv
Invoice No,Invoice Date,Vendor,Amount,Currency
INV-1042,2026-09-15,Acme Ltd,500.00,USD
INV-1043,2026-09-16,Globex,invalid,USD
```

## Process

```text
Upload CSV
  -> Store original file
  -> Parse headers, rows, and cells
  -> Create canonical representation
  -> Validate source headers
  -> Parse and validate source values
  -> Quarantine invalid rows
  -> Map valid source fields to internal fields
  -> Validate internal business rules
  -> Store usable records with lineage
```

The same logical process applies to JSON. The source location changes from CSV row/column coordinates to a JSONPath.

### 1. Store the original file

Store the exact uploaded file once in object storage, for example:

```text
documents/doc_123/source.csv
```

Record its document ID, original filename, format, content hash, upload timestamp, source, and access metadata. The original file is immutable evidence and supports replay. Do not store a redundant JSON copy of the entire CSV.

### 2. Parse the CSV

Read the encoding, delimiter, header row, rows, and cells. At this stage, every cell is a string. Record its precise source location.

```json
{
  "source_row": 2,
  "cells": [
    {"source_header": "Invoice No", "raw_value": "INV-1042"},
    {"source_header": "Amount", "raw_value": "500.00"}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Create a canonical representation

Persist parsed source data in a generic, format-independent structure. The canonical structure retains source headers, raw values, row/column locations, parsed values, and validation results. It is not yet an invoice or other internal business object.

```json
{
  "document_id": "doc_123",
  "format": "csv",
  "source_row": 2,
  "cell": {
    "source_header": "Amount",
    "raw_value": "500.00",
    "location": {"row": 2, "column": "Amount"}
  }
}
```

### 4. Validate source headers

Apply a versioned source contract.

```yaml
required_headers:
  - Invoice No
  - Invoice Date
  - Amount
  - Currency

header_aliases:
  Invoice #: Invoice No
  Invoice Number: Invoice No
```

Validate that required headers exist, headers are not duplicated, aliases are recognized, and unexpected headers follow the configured policy.

### 5. Parse and validate source values

The source contract defines field types and constraints.

```yaml
fields:
  Invoice No:
    type: string
    required: true
  Invoice Date:
    type: date
    format: yyyy-MM-dd
    required: true
  Amount:
    type: decimal
    required: true
    min: 0
    scale: 2
  Currency:
    type: string
    allowed_values: [USD, INR, EUR]
```

For a numeric field, first preserve the original text, then parse it using the declared locale and formatting rules. Use decimal arithmetic for money rather than floating point.

```json
{
  "source_header": "Amount",
  "raw_value": "500.00",
  "parsed_value": 500.00,
  "expected_type": "decimal",
  "validation_status": "passed",
  "location": {"row": 2, "column": "Amount"}
}
```

An invalid value stays visible with a precise reason.

```json
{
  "source_header": "Amount",
  "raw_value": "invalid",
  "parsed_value": null,
  "expected_type": "decimal",
  "validation_status": "failed",
  "error_code": "not_a_number",
  "location": {"row": 3, "column": "Amount"}
}
```

### 6. Quarantine invalid rows

Rows with failed required validation do not become internal business records. Preserve them in the canonical layer with validation issues for review or correction.

```text
Row 2: valid -> continue
Row 3: Amount is not a decimal -> quarantine
```

### 7. Map valid source fields to the internal model

Apply a separate, versioned mapping contract only to valid source values.

```yaml
source_to_internal_mapping:
  Invoice No: invoice.invoice_number
  Invoice Date: invoice.invoice_date
  Vendor: invoice.vendor_name
  Amount: invoice.total_amount
  Currency: invoice.currency
```

The result is an application-friendly object with retained lineage.

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-1042",
  "invoice_date": "2026-09-15",
  "vendor_name": "Acme Ltd",
  "total_amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "lineage": {
    "invoice.total_amount": {
      "source_header": "Amount",
      "source_location": {"document_id": "doc_123", "row": 2, "column": "Amount"},
      "raw_value": "500.00",
      "mapping_contract_version": "supplier-invoice-to-internal-v1"
    }
  }
}
```

### 8. Validate internal business rules

Validate constraints that belong to the internal application, such as invoice-number uniqueness, supported currencies, known vendor resolution, and business-specific date rules. A source value can be structurally valid but still fail an internal rule.

### 9. Store the results

Maintain three logical categories of data:

1. Original file: immutable `source.csv` stored once.
2. Canonical records: source headers, raw values, parsed typed values, locations, validation outcomes, and errors.
3. Internal records: validated, mapped domain objects such as invoices, each linked back to its canonical source data.

## JSON object processing

JSON is structurally richer than CSV. A JSON document may contain nested objects, arrays, numbers, booleans, and null values. Preserve the original JSON document once, then represent each JSON value in the canonical layer with its JSONPath.

### JSON example input

```json
{
  "supplier": "Acme Ltd",
  "invoices": [
    {
      "invoiceNo": "INV-1042",
      "invoiceDate": "2026-09-15",
      "amount": "500.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "invoiceNo": "INV-1043",
      "invoiceDate": "2026-09-16",
      "amount": "invalid",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1. Store the original JSON once

Store the unchanged file, for example:

```text
documents/doc_124/source.json
```

The original file remains the source evidence. Store document metadata and a content hash as for CSV.

### 2. Parse JSON and create canonical nodes

Parse JSON while retaining its hierarchy. Each canonical value has a path that identifies its exact source location.

```json
{
  "document_id": "doc_124",
  "format": "json",
  "path": "$.invoices[0].amount",
  "source_key": "amount",
  "raw_value": "500.00",
  "json_type": "string"
}
```

An object or array can also be retained as a canonical structural node:

```json
{
  "path": "$.invoices",
  "node_type": "array",
  "child_count": 2
}
```

For JSON, a business record is usually one item in an array. Here, `$.invoices[0]` and `$.invoices[1]` are invoice records.

### 3. Validate the JSON source contract

The JSON source contract defines required paths, expected JSON types, and value constraints.

```yaml
source_contract:
  name: supplier-invoices-json
  version: v1
  record_path: $.invoices[*]
  fields:
    invoiceNo:
      path: $.invoiceNo
      type: string
      required: true
    invoiceDate:
      path: $.invoiceDate
      type: date
      format: yyyy-MM-dd
      required: true
    amount:
      path: $.amount
      type: decimal
      required: true
      min: 0
      scale: 2
    currency:
      path: $.currency
      type: string
      allowed_values: [USD, INR, EUR]
```

The `record_path` identifies the repeatable source entity. Each relative field path is evaluated within one record.

### 4. Validate JSON values

JSON has native types, but source contracts remain necessary. A JSON number may be valid JSON but invalid for money because it is negative or has too many decimal places. A JSON string may need parsing as a date or decimal.

For the example, `$.invoices[0].amount` is a string, so the pipeline parses it as a decimal without losing the original value:

```json
{
  "path": "$.invoices[0].amount",
  "raw_value": "500.00",
  "json_type": "string",
  "parsed_value": 500.00,
  "expected_type": "decimal",
  "validation_status": "passed"
}
```

The second amount fails and its containing invoice object is quarantined:

```json
{
  "record_path": "$.invoices[1]",
  "field_path": "$.invoices[1].amount",
  "raw_value": "invalid",
  "validation_status": "failed",
  "error_code": "not_a_number"
}
```

### 5. Map validated JSON fields to the internal model

Use a separate mapping contract. It maps source paths rather than CSV headers.

```yaml
mapping_contract:
  name: supplier-invoice-json-to-internal
  version: v1
  mappings:
    $.invoiceNo: invoice.invoice_number
    $.invoiceDate: invoice.invoice_date
    $.amount: invoice.total_amount
    $.currency: invoice.currency
```

For the first JSON invoice, the resulting internal record is the same as for CSV:

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-1042",
  "invoice_date": "2026-09-15",
  "total_amount": 500.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "lineage": {
    "invoice.total_amount": {
      "source_document": "doc_124",
      "source_path": "$.invoices[0].amount",
      "raw_value": "500.00",
      "mapping_contract_version": "v1"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Validate the internal record and store results

Run the same internal business validation as CSV: unique invoice number, supported currency, vendor resolution, and other business rules. Valid records are persisted as internal business records. Invalid records and their JSONPath-based errors remain in the canonical layer.

## Common source-contract pattern

CSV and JSON use the same concept with different source locators:

| Concept | CSV | JSON |
|---|---|---|
| Repeatable record | Row | Array item, such as `$.invoices[*]` |
| Source field identifier | Header, such as `Amount` | JSONPath, such as `$.amount` |
| Source location | Row + column | JSONPath, such as `$.invoices[0].amount` |
| Raw value | Cell string | JSON primitive or serialized representation |
| Mapping source | Header → internal field | Path → internal field |

## Final architecture

```text
source.csv or source.json
  -> Original-file storage
  -> Canonical records (raw value + typed value + source location + validation)
  -> Validated mapping contract
  -> Internal business records with field-level lineage
```

The canonical layer is the durable source representation. Internal tables are useful projections for applications and can be rebuilt from valid canonical data and versioned mapping rules.
